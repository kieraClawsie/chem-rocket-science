			<p class="paragraph">The spacecraft that we launch require electrical power. Unfortunately, regular double A batteries
				simply don’t cut it for most missions.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img class="figure" src="images/doublea.jpg" style="width: 30vw; margin-left: -10vw;"><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph">Since the start of space exploration, humanity has been developing and testing increasingly
				durable and powerful battery technology in space. The operations of these batteries are crucial
				to the success of any mission, since they power important systems on the spacecraft including
				navigation, communication, and astronaut life support.<br><br>

			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph left floatLeft" style="font-size: 3.75vh; line-height: 5.625vh;">Over the past 60 years, many different batteries have been used, each with their own benefits
					and drawbacks. The most commonly used batteries have been nickel cadmium, nickel
					hydrogen, and lithium ion. These batteries have to be extremely rugged, able to withstand the
					incredible pressures at launch, as well as operate over a wide temperature range in the vacuum
					of space.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left indent">Nickel Cadmium Batteries</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">One of the earlier batteries used in space, nickel cadmium batteries have been a staple of
				space missions since 1959. The first NiCd battery was used on the Explorer 6, which took some
				of the first photos of earth from space. The battery continued in use on many weather satellites,
				orbiting the earth.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph left floatLeft" style="font-size: 4.25vh; line-height: 6.25vh;">The operation of a nickel cadmium battery requires the knowledge of some basic
					electrochemistry. It operates as an electrolytic cell, with a positively charged electrode of nickel
					(III) oxide-hydroxide and a negatively charged electrode of cadmium. These are separated by
					an electrolyte, commonly potassium hydroxide.
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/bat2.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">At the anode, cadmium combines with hydroxide ions to form cadmium hydroxide and release
				two electrons:<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">Cd + 2OH<sup>-</sup> → Cd(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">At the cathode, nickel (III) oxide-hydroxide reacts with water to form nickel hydroxide and
				hydroxide ions. This reaction consumes two electrons:<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">2NiOOH + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e<sup>-</sup> → Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>-</sup><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The complete balanced equation for a nickel cadmium battery is:<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">2NiOOH + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cd → Cd(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">The current formed by the moving electrons powers all the instruments and systems onboard
				the spacecraft. Nickel cadmium batteries are rare in modern spacecraft, but they were the prime choice for
				missions in the 60s. They were used because nickel cadmium batteries are able to withstand
				rough situations and cold temperatures, making them ideal for spacecraft. In addition to this,
				they are more energy dense when compared to the other batteries at the time<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Unfortunately, there are a couple drawbacks. Cadmium can be fairly expensive, because of its
				rarity. Also, a nickel cadmium battery requires an intricate setup to charge, which adds to
				possible complications during flight.<br><br></p>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Nickel Hydrogen Batteries</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Nickel hydrogen batteries are the successor of nickel cadmium batteries. They were first used
				as a backup to the NiCd batteries during a space flight, but were the sole power source for the
				intelsat V in 1983. Nowadays, NiH<sub>2</sub> batteries are used in satellites, primarily satellites in
				geostationary orbit. Nickel hydrogen batteries have many notable uses. They’re used in the
				Hubble Space Telescope and were used to power the international space station<br><br>ckel hydrogen batteries use the same cathode as nickel cadmium batteries, nickel (III)
				oxide-hydroxide, and the same anode as a fuel cell, hydrogen gas.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right" style="font-size: 4.5vh; line-height: 8vh;">In a fuel cell reaction, the hydrogen loses an electron, creating a hydrogen ion. The ion passes
					through the electrolyte while the electrons pass through a wire, creating a current. The electron
					is then used in a reaction to create H2O.<br><br>
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/bat3.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">A nickel hydrogen battery uses hydrogen gas in the same way:<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">½H<sub>2</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2</sub>O + e<sup>-</sup><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The nickel (III) oxide-hydroxide combines with water and an electron to create nickel hydroxide
				and a hydroxide ion:<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">NiOOH + H<sub>2</sub>O + e<sup>-</sup> → Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The complete balanced reaction for a nickel hydrogen battery is:<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">NiOOH + ½H<sub>2</sub> → Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub><br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph right">Nickel hydrogen batteries combine these two existing technologies to create a battery
				worthwhile of space travel. These batteries have a long life and are able to charge and
				discharge many times without degrading. Unfortunately, nickel hydrogen requires battery
				conditioning if it doesn’t completely charge and recharge on a single cycle.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Lithium Ion Batteries</h2>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/bat4.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Lithium ion batteries are extremely common. You probably have one in the device that you’re
					using to read this. These batteries are being used in many spacecraft for the same reasons that
					device manufacturers are using them. Lithium ion batteries are lighter and smaller than many
					other kinds of batteries, including nickel hydrogen. They also are much more energy efficient
					and easy to access, thanks to their commonality in consumer devices.
					<br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/bat5.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">Unfortunately, they do have a tendency to explode or catch fire. (Remember Samsung’s Galaxy
					Note 7?) Considering using these on a spacecraft has required space agencies to perform
					many tests and develop additional safety features for the lithium ion batteries used on space
					ships.
					<br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Lithium ion batteries use lithium-cobalt oxide as a positive electrode and graphite as a negative
				electrode. When the battery is charging, the positive electrode releases a lithium ion along with
				its electron. The lithium ion moves through the electrolyte, while the electrons move through the
				wire, meeting at the graphite. When discharging the battery, the electrons move back through
				the wire and the lithium ions move back through the electrolyte. The flow of ions and electrons
				are interconnected, one will not cross without the other. When the battery is disconnected from
				whatever it is powering, the electrons will stop, stopping the flow of lithium ions as well.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">As the reign of nickel hydrogen batteries comes to an end, the lithium ion batteries have
				become the next giant in spacecraft power sources and will likely continue to be used until a
				better battery is created. As recently as January of 2017, all of the nickel hydrogen batteries on
				the ISS were replaced with lithium ion batteries, including the smaller batteries powering space
				suits!</p>
