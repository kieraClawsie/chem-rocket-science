			<p class="paragraph left indent">I was responsible for researching rocket boosters. This meant finding and explaining precisely
				how various different types of rocket boosters use propellants to generate thrust for the rocket. This included finding specific
				information about specific propellants, and analyzing the thermochemistry behind their combustion to illustrate their efficiency
				as fuels. My work can be found in the "Boosters" section of the website. I was responsible for the section of the video between
				5:10 and 8:45. I also coded the website from scratch using HTML and CSS. This meant taking my findings and the findings of others
				and organizing them into the website you see now.<br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Eric Li</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">I was responsible for the electroplating part of the project, which included a chemistry related demonstration
				with a diagram, as well as additional research on its uses in the space industry. My part on electroplating was fairly simple and short,
				which is why I volunteered to edit most of the video too. This part can be found in the "Plating" section of the website. I also have a
				3D printer, and decided to put it to use by 3D modeling a rocket, and Jim helped launch it using materials we had around the house.<br><br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Jim Liu</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">I was responsible for the "Polymers" section of the project which included extensive and in depth research of the use
				of organic materials in aerospace applications. My section included a real world case study of polyaniline and its applications in the shuttle program.
				Furthermore, I detailed the use of various polymers in the aerospace industry as a whole. In addition to the aforementioned section, I collaborated with
				Eric to build and launch rockets for our demonstration. This involved sourcing the materials needed for the rocket motor, building and launching the rocket,
				and creating an explanation for the whole process. Lastly I created an interactive kahoot to engage the audience during the presentation.<br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Matthew Prenevost</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">I was responsible for the propellants segment of this project. This included researching various types of propellants, fuels and oxidizers and
				the principles that both allow them to function, and make some more efficient than others. This work can be found in the "Fuels" section of the website. I
				also planned the layout of the video, and was responsible for creating the section of the video from the beginning to 5:10.<br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Om Shanbhag</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Our genius hour project was divided into various sections. I chose to find the types of batteries used in space along with
				their processes. When doing this section, I tasked myself with finding connections between our topic and the second unit covered in class, electrochemistry.
				I drew from the understanding that we developed in class to explain and relate nickel cadmium, nickel hydrogen, and lithium ion batteries to the concepts
				that my classmates knew. I assembled all of my information into a thorough write through, using easy-to-understand language and helpful pictures to explain
				the processes and uses; this can be found in the "Power" section of the website. I also created the part of the video that explains batteries. For this section,
				I combined the research I previously conducted with some speaking language in order to communicate the information efficiently and with comfort.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Week 1: March 17th, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">This week, we decided on our topic: rocket science! Rockets, and space travel as a whole,
				are going to be incredibly important to the future of humanity, and chemistry is ultimately at the core of everything.
				By showing the chemical concepts that allow space travel to exist, we believe that we will be shedding much-needed light on
				the inner workings of such an important technology. Beyond that, we just think that it's going to be really interesting to
				learn about! We've begun looking for sources, and filtering out the less-than-reputable sources, and we believe we will be 
				able to start developing the website by next week!<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle right">Week 2: March 23rd, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Now that we were sure of our topic, we began to decide how we should tackle this project. Due to the
				significant amount of work ahead of us, we decided to divide and conquer. The science of rockets is incredibly varied, so
				choosing parts of it that correlated with the information that we learned in class was quite simple. After some preliminary
				research, we discussed the topics that we felt were appropriate for the project. We chose to base our presentation around the
				rocket fuel, electroplating, batteries, rocket boosters, and the polymers involved in the creation and operation of rockets.
				From here, we each chose one of the topics to become an expert in, starting our research and preparing our part to add to the
				website and video. This week, we also chose to divide up the task of writing out the journal entries. To keep the work divided
				fairly and provide varied opinions on our project, we each chose a week to journal about.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left" style="margin-right: 16vw;">Week 3: March 31st, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Our efforts in the third week were divided into 3 main sections. Firstly, we conducted extensive
				research on our topics to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry behind them. This involved using numerous sources
				and cross checking our references. While websites and blogs were our preferred sources of information, we also used videos
				and research papers as well. One of the more notable events to happen during week 3 was the launch of our demonstration
				rockets. After countless hours of research and construction, we went to a flying field in Oakville where we successfully
				launched Falcon 1 and 2. After we 3D printed the rockets from PETG, it was a simple exercise to short 2 9V batteries in
				order to generate the spark required to ignite the motor. The combustion of the solid propellant and the oxidizer generated
				enough thrust to launch the model rocket. Unfortunately neither Falcon 1 or 2 were recovered. We further developed our website
				this week.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle right">Week 4: April 8th, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">We are starting to finalize our research and believe that we have gathered enough information throughout
				the past three weeks on the chemistry of rocket science. Our findings in our five sections (the science
				behind rocket fuels/propellants, rocket boosters, the power and batteries involved, electroplating, and the polymers involved) have
				been very lucrative this week. We've
				also made a lot of progress on our website (which is almost complete) now that we have all of the necessary information needed to put onto the website. Kyle
				decided to code our website using HTML and CSS. We have had experience creating websites with these markup and styling languages
				beforehand, so the additional control given to us by writing the website ouselves has been very useful so far, and hasn't slowed us down.
				We feel like we are on
				the right track towards finish our project and we will be able to present our findings when we present on the week of the 19th!<br><br>

			<p class="paragraph left">Everything is complete! We've completed our research, and organized it all into the website in our 5 categories. We
				also completed our video! We took our findings in each category and each chose one section to focus on. After that, we each spoke about our
				section and edited each video snippet together to create our final product! At this point, all we have left to do is create our Kahoot and
				practice our presentation!<br><br>
