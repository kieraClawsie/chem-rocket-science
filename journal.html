			<h2 class="subtitle left">Week 1: March 17th, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">This week, we decided on our topic: rocket science! Rockets, and space travel as a whole,
				are going to be incredibly important to the future of humanity, and chemistry is ultimately at the core of everything.
				By showing the chemical concepts that allow space travel to exist, we believe that we will be shedding much-needed light on
				the inner workings of such an important technology. Beyond that, we just think that it's going to be really interesting to
				learn about! We've begun looking for sources, and filtering out the less-than-reputable sources, and we believe we will be 
				able to start developing the website by next week!<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle right">Week 2: March 23rd, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Now that we were sure of our topic, we began to decide how we should tackle this project. Due to the
				significant amount of work ahead of us, we decided to divide and conquer. The science of rockets is incredibly varied, so
				choosing parts of it that correlated with the information that we learned in class was quite simple. After some preliminary
				research, we discussed the topics that we felt were appropriate for the project. We chose to base our presentation around the
				rocket fuel, electroplating, batteries, rocket boosters, and the polymers involved in the creation and operation of rockets.
				From here, we each chose one of the topics to become an expert in, starting our research and preparing our part to add to the
				website and video. This week, we also chose to divide up the task of writing out the journal entries. To keep the work divided
				fairly and provide varied opinions on our project, we each chose a week to journal about.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left" style="margin-right: 16vw;">Week 3: March 31st, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Our efforts in the third week were divided into 3 main sections. Firstly, we conducted extensive
				research on our topics to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry behind them. This involved using numerous sources
				and cross checking our references. While websites and blogs were our preferred sources of information, we also used videos
				and research papers as well. One of the more notable events to happen during week 3 was the launch of our demonstration
				rockets. After countless hours of research and construction, we went to a flying field in Oakville where we successfully
				launched Falcon 1 and 2. After we 3D printed the rockets from PETG, it was a simple exercise to short 2 9V batteries in
				order to generate the spark required to ignite the motor. The combustion of the solid propellant and the oxidizer generated
				enough thrust to launch the model rocket. Unfortunately neither Falcon 1 or 2 were recovered. We further developed our website
				this week.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle right">Week 4: April 8th, 2021</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">We are starting to finalize our research and believe that we have gathered enough information throughout
				the past three weeks on the chemistry of rocket science. Our findings in our five sections (the science
				behind rocket fuels/propellants, rocket boosters, the power and batteries involved, electroplating, and the polymers involved) have
				been very lucrative this week. We've
				also made a lot of progress on our website (which is almost complete) now that we have all of the necessary information needed to put onto the website. Kyle
				decided to code our website using HTML and CSS. We have had experience creating websites with these markup and styling languages
				beforehand, so the additional control given to us by writing the website ouselves has been very useful so far, and hasn't slowed us down.
				We feel like we are on
				the right track towards finish our project and we will be able to present our findings when we present on the week of the 19th!<br><br>

			<p class="paragraph left">Everythings is complete! We've completed our research, and organized it all into the website in our 5 categories. We
				also completed our video!We took our findings in each category and each chose one section to focus on. After that, we each spoke about our
				section and edited each video snippet together to create our final product! At this point, all we have left to do is create our Kahoot and
				practice our presentation!<br><br>
