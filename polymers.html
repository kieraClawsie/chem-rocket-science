			<h2 class="subtitle left indent">The Space Shuttle</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">With the launch of space shuttle Columbia on the 12th of April 1981, a new era of
				space exploration began. Thanks to the countless hours put in across various industries, humanity finally had a
				reliable method to access the stars. No sooner had Columbia returned than preparations for its next flight (STS-2)
				began. However the team at NASA soon faced an issue that could potentially bring the program to a halt. <br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph right">Located in Cape Canaveral Florida, the Kennedy Space Center and the shuttle launch pad
				itself was no stranger to the salty floridian air. However under prolonged exposure to these conditions, it was
				found that the launch pad soon began to rust. Rusting of iron is a redox reaction in which Fe<sup>2+</sup> is
				oxidized by atmosphere oxygen to form Fe<sup>3+</sup>.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 8vh;">4Fe<sub>(s)</sub> + 3O<sub><sub>2</sub>(g)</sub> → 2Fe<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O<sub><sub>3</sub>(s)</sub></p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph left floatLeft" style="font-size: 3.5vh; line-height: 5.25vh;">Not only does rust look bad on
					the otherwise metallic looking structure, it poses a serious problem to the structural integrity of the launch
					pad. It was also found that the exhaust fumes generated by the booster rockets on takeoff produced hydrochloric
					acid; a very acidic substance that can easily corrode metal. Not so fun fact for NASA: A cubic centimeter of iron
					can produce 3 cubic centimeters of rust.<br><br>
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/p1.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">In order to prevent the structural deterioration of the launch pad, NASA
				had to repaint the surface of the launch pad in a protective coating after every launch. Unfortunately, both air
				and moisture could permeate through the paint, so their solution would only be a temporary one. <br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph right">Enter Polyaniline (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sup>-</sup>), an organic polymer discovered in
				the early 1860’s that was found to have surprising capabilities in the fight against rust. In collaboration with the
				Los Alamos National Laboratory, it was discovered that the launch pad could be coated with polyaniline in order to prevent the
				rapid rusting and corrosion caused by Florida’s climate in conjunction with the space flights.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img class="figure" src="images/poly.jpg" style="width: 80vw;"><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">An experiment was conducted in which identical samples of iron were placed in a diluted solution of
				hydrochloric acid. One was coated with the polymer, whilst the other was left untouched. After 4 weeks, the uncoated block began
				to show signs of rusting while the coated block remained rust free. The experiment was successfully concluded after 25 weeks after
				which the uncoated block was shown to have heavily rusted, while the coated block remained in its original state. NASA’s subsequent
				use of polyaniline coating is estimated to have saved over $250 000 a year in maintenance costs for various equipment and structures.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle right" style="margin-right: 16vw;">The Aerospace Industry</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">As one of the leading consumers of high grade materials, the aerospace industry has benefited from the introduction
				of polymers and various composite materials. These materials often provide the structural rigidity required at a fraction of the mass of
				traditional materials. Their high development costs are made cheaper by the discovery of new manufacturing methods as well as mass
				production in general. Furthermore, the weight reduction means an increase in fuel efficiency as well as serviceable range, further
				offsetting the initial cost of development. Many of these materials have not only trickled up into aeronautical engineering, but also
				trickled down into more everyday products.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/p2.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">Polyaryletherketones are a group of semi-crystalline
					thermoplastics (organic polymers) made from Phenylene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) rings with a molecular backbone consisting of an
					alternating pattern of ketone (R-C=O-R) and ether (R-O-R) groups (oxy).
				</p>
			</div><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph right">Consequently, polyaryletherketones possess many properties that make them ideal for the aerospace
				industry such as: being lightweight, being resistant to corrosion, being able to withstand extreme temperatures, and most of all; being durable.
				For this reason, two of their decedent polymers have found widespread success in the aerospace industry.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph left">Polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, is one of the most readily found polymers in the aerospace industry. In addition to
				all of the aforementioned properties, it further possesses:<br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">- Low Flammability<br></p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">- Resistance to Creep (deformation over time)<br></p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">- Resistance to Radiation<br></p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">- Resistance to Hydrolysis<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph">Polyetheretherketone can be found in pump gears, valve seats, flight control, fuel systems, interiors, and engines among numerous other uses.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img class="figure" src="images/peek.jpg" style="width: 40vw; margin-left: -10vw;"><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">In a similar manner to polyetheretherketone, polyetherketoneketone or, PEKK, possesses countless attributes that make it
				perfect for applications in aerospace. Like its more popular cousin, PEKK is also a semi crystalline thermoplastic derived from the organic
				polyaryletherketones family. Like PEEK, it carries with it many of the same attributes, along with a couple others such as:<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left" style="line-height:7vh;">- High Heat Resistance<br>- High Chemical Resistance<br>- Sturdy, yet Flexible (reportedly as strong as aluminum at
				only 40% of its mass)<br>- High Load Tolerance<br><br></p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/pekk.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph right">PEKK does have a unique attribute in its ability to be able to be manufactured in an additive process. Unlike traditional materials, PEKK can be built
				layer by layer instead of molded or block cut. What results is a process very similar to 3d printing, but of much higher quality. 
				PEKK can be found throughout rockets and spacecraft in particular. Since 2010, PEKK has been used by Boeing in its Starliner program.
