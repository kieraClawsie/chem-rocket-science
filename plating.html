		<div class="interlude top">Electroplating</div>
		<div class="info dark">
			<p class="paragraph">Electroplating is the process of coating one metal onto another metal using an electrolytic cell. Electroplating
				can be used in a variety of different applications, from increasing corrosion resistance, or improving the aesthetic appearance of
				a product (like in jewelry). Electroplating is a fairly easy concept, and requires four main components; The anode, the cathode, a
				solution, and a power source. In chemistry, the resulting reaction is called a “redox” reaction (reduction and oxidation reaction).
				Once the positively charged electrode and negatively charged electrode (anode and cathode, respectively) are placed in the solution
				and connected, the battery supplies a current to the anode, causing the anode to oxidize and allowing the cathode to reduce.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/plat1.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">Let’s take a look at a common electroplating process of coating a spoon with silver, using Silver
					(Ag) as the anode, and a cheap metal as the cathode. When power is supplied to the anode, the silver atoms dissolve in the electrolyte
					solution (Silver Nitrate) as positive ions after being oxidized. The current then moves these ions onto the metal spoon, and the
					resulting product is a silver-plated spoon.<br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">The reaction at the cathode:</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">Ag → Ag<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup><br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph">The reaction at the anode:</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">Ag<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> → Ag<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph">Space is not exactly a safe environment, and engineers must take into consideration the many different factors and threats
				that could damage spacecraft and satellites orbiting the Earth. The following issues arise commonly in
				satellites, and can be solved with electroplating.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Extreme Light and Radiation</h2>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Although humans see the sun every day from Earth, that isn’t to say light from the sun is safe. Because
					Earth has an atmosphere, the radiation and heat from the sun is dissipated, reflected, or absorbed before it reaches us. Satellites are
					exposed to the direct sunlight, and are easily damaged from the heat and glare. Builders and engineers can use electroplating to place
					reflective metals and/or metallic insulation to prevent heat damage to sensitive components.<br><br>
				</p>

			</div>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Thermal Cycling</h2>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/plat3.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">Spacecrafts in orbit undergo a process called “thermal cycling”, which is the process of materials
					expanding and contracting from drastic temperature changes. This degrades the materials used in spacecraft over time. Electroplating
					allows for better heat dissipation across the entire spacecraft.<br><br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Atomic Oxygen</h2>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Atomic oxygen affects all objects in space, and is produced when UV radiation reaches the oxygen in
					the upper atmosphere on Earth. AO is a free radical, meaning it has an unpaired electron  which makes it highly reactive. AO oxidizes
					metals much faster than typical molecular oxygen molecules, and as such, electroplating is used to combat this oxidation.<br><br>
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/plat4.jpg">
			</div>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Space Debris</h2>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">Satellites orbit at very high speeds, along with other space debris. At such high speeds, collisions
					with small objects can cause extreme damage, and thus electroplating is used to coat and increase the strength of the exterior.<br><br>
				</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Why Is Gold So Common?</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Although gold is very expensive, a lot of NASA’s satellites and spacecraft use a generous amount for electroplating.
				Gold has many unique and valuable properties to the space industry, including corrosion resistance, radiation reflectivity, light absorption,
				malleability, and conductivity.<br><br></p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Cheaper metals such as copper tarnish quickly out in space,  but pure gold does not tarnish at all. In
					terms of reflectivity, gold has the unique property of being able to reflect infrared radiation, as well as ultraviolet radiation,
					better than most other metals. On the topic of reflectivity, gold absorbs a lot of light, meaning hotspots, blinding lights, and glares
					caused by reflections are eliminated when using this metal.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/gold.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Last but not least, gold is an extremely malleable metal, meaning it can
				form intricate shapes and patterns, even when stretched. This makes it easy to work with when manufacturing and designing spacecraft.<br><br></p>
