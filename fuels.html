		<div class="interlude top">Rocket Boosters</div>
		<div class="info dark">
			<p class="paragraph">The rocket booster is integral to the function of the rocket; without propulsion, a
				rocket is purposeless. Boosters work by channeling the (highly exothermic) combustion of various
				propellants. This combustion produces gases (often referred to as exhaust gases), which, when ejected
				through the booster's nozzle, provides a great deal of thrust.<br><br>There are 3 main types of rocket
				booster: <b>SRB (Solid Rocket Booster)</b>, <b>LRB (Liquid Rocket Booster)</b>, and <b>HRB (Hybrid
				Rocket Booster)</b>. Hybrid Boosters are generally used far less than SRBs and LRBs, and are much less
				prevalent in space travel, so this page focuses primarily on SRBs and LRBs.

		<div class="info light">
			<h2 class="subtitle left indent">Solid Rocket Booster</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">SRBs are the largest boosters used by a rocket; these boosters, due to their
				size and mass, are discarded from the rocket during launch. This ejection of mass not only provides some
				thrust, but also allows the LRBs to be more efficient in their propulsion for the remainder of the mission.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph left floatLeft" style="font-size: 3.5vh; line-height: 5.25vh;">SRBs, as the name suggests,
					use solid fuel. Once inside the booster, this fuel is often referred to as 'grain' due to the fact that
					it's, well, granular. The ignition charge, once detonated, provides the necessary activation energy for
					the combustion reaction to take place (solid fuels are mixed with their oxidizer beforehand, but kept
					at extremely cold temperatures before combustion). The hollow chamber at the core of the booster maximizes
					the exposed fuel, and thus maximizes the thrust of the booster.

			</div>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 4.5vh;">There are two main classifications of propellant used in Solid Rocket Boosters: Homogeneous
				propellant, and Composite propellant.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Homogeneous Propellant</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Homogeneous propellants are just defined as propellants whose compositions are entirely
				uniform. Despite this, there are still two subcategories of homogeneous propellant; single-base, and
				double-base. Both types use (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub>,
				also known as nitrocellulose, dissolved in ethanol as the primary combustible.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/nc.png">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right" style="font-size: 3.75vh; line-height: 5.25vh;">In single-base homogeneous propellants, nitrocellulose dissolved in ethanol
					is practically the only ingredient. Double-base homogeneous propellants also contain
					a secondary combustible, typically C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>
					(known as 1,2,3-trinitroxypropane, or, more commonly, nitroglycerin). This secondary combustible acts
					as a stabilizer.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph right">Homogeneous propellants are not typically used for space travel. This is simply due to their
				relatively inefficient performance; they provide relatively little thrust for their mass. This lack of efficiency
				can be described as a "low specific impulse", or a low I<sub>sp</sub>.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Composite Propellant</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Composite propellants, also called heterogeneous propellants, are simply propellants which
				are <i>not</i> entirely uniform. The two most common types of composite propellant are Ammonium Perchlorate Composite
				Propellant (APCP) and Ammonium Nitrate Composite Propellant (ANCP). Both types typically use Aluminum metal as fuel, as
				Aluminum has a high energy density (specifically 4.8 × 10<sup>7</sup> kJ/m<sup>3</sup>) and is difficult to accidentally ignite, making it an ideal fuel.
				APCP is used far more than ANCP because of its higher specific impulse, or I<sub>sp</sub> (thrust-mass efficiency).<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/apcp.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Standard APCP is composed of 69% Ammonium Perchlorate (NH<sub>4</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>),
					16% Aluminum (Al), 12% Polybutadiene Acrylonitrile (referred to as PBAN, or polybutadiene prop-2-enenitrile),
					2% Epoxide, and 1% Iron Oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). This APCP is commonly used in space travel.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">All composite propellants are composed of a polymeric matrix (also called a polymeric binder),
				which envelopes a granular solid oxidizer and a granular metal fuel. In the APCP detailed above, there are many components,
				but each has its own specific purpose. The Aluminum metal acts as the primary fuel. The Ammonium Perchlorate acts as the oxidizer.
				The PBAN acts as the polymeric binder, but can also behave as a secondary fuel. The Epoxide acts as a curing agent for the
				PBAN. Curing is the process of cross-linking polymer chains in order to increase the rigidity, or "toughness", of the polymer.
				The Iron Oxide acts as a catalyst for the reaction, lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to take place.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">The combustion reaction that the APCP detailed above undergoes is as follows:</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 5vh;">10Al<sub>(s)</sub> + 6NH<sub><sub>4</sub></sub>ClO<sub><sub>4</sub>(s)</sub> →
				4Al<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O<sub><sub>3</sub>(s)</sub> + 2AlCl<sub><sub>3</sub>(s)</sub> + 12H<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
				+ 3N<sub><sub>2</sub>(g)</sub>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Hess's Law states that the sum of the heats of formation of the products of a reaction minus the sum of
				the heats of the formation of the reactants is equal to the net change in enthalpy of the reaction. Using this, and the
				standard heats of formation for each reactant and product, the net enthalpy change of this reaction can be found.<br><br></br>
				ΔH = (4(-1657.7) + 2(-584.6) + 12(-241.8) + 3(0)) - (10(0) + 6(-295.8))<br>ΔH = -8926.8 kJ<br><br>Evidently, the combustion
				of APCP is incredibly exothermic. Although this is only an approximation of real-world conditions, this shows why APCP is
				such a popular solid propellant.

			<h2 class="subtitle right" style="margin-right: 16vw;">Liquid Rocket Booster</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">LRBs generally serve the purpose of secondary propulsion. Where SRBs provide the main thrust to
				permit a rocket's escape from the Earth's gravity, and are then ejected, LRBs are never released from the rocket. These
				boosters, which allow for a more controlled combustion, are typically used to propel rockets through
				space and for maneuvering.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/lrb.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right" style="font-size: 3.75vh; line-height: 5.625vh;">LRBs, which, by definition, use
					liquid propellant, store the fuel and the oxidizer in different tanks. The fuel and oxidizer are brought into the
					combustion chamber through controlled pumps, which allows for the combustion, and by extension, the propulsion, to
					be finely and acutely controlled. This control is precisely what makes LRBs ideal for use as secondary propulsion and for maneuvering
					purposes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 4.5vh;">There are three main classifications of propellant used in Liquid Rocket Boosters:
				Petroleum propellant, Hypergolic propellant, and Cryogenic propellant. <br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Petroleum Propellant</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Petroleum propellants, are, not unexpectedly, propellants based on petroleum, otherwise
				known as crude oil. These propellants generally offer middling specific impulse, and are almost always less efficient
				than cryogenic propellants; the upside is that they can be stored at room temperature, and are cheaper.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">The most common type of petroleum propellant used in space travel (by far) is
					called RP-1, which either stands for Rocket Propellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1. As its second name indicates,
					all this is is essentially very refined petroleum. Specifically, RP-1 is a refined kerosene (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>26</sub>
					− C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>32</sub>), which is already a distilled petroleum mixture. RP-1, like all petroleum propellants,
					doesn't spontaneously combust like its hypergolic counterparts. Because of this, the boosters that
					use RP-1 (or any petroleum propellant) must be structured differently than standard Liquid Rocket Boosters.<br><br>
				</p>
				<img class="figure floatRight"src="images/rp1.jpg">
			</div>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Hypergolic Propellant</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Hypergolic propellants are defined simply as fuels that rapidly, spontaneously combust when
				coming into contact with their oxidizers. This spontaneity allows for an incredible degree of control over the 
				thrust that boosters using hypergolic propellants supply. This also allows for a simple LRB structure.
				Accidental combustion is a greater hazard with these propellants.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<img class="figure floatLeft"src="images/hydrazine.jpg">
				<p class="paragraph floatRight right">The most common hypergolic propellant is hydrazine, or N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.
					Other organic hydrazine variants are occasionally used, but hydrazine itself is a cornerstone in hypergolic propellants.
					One such variant, which is the most commonly used variant (other than simple hydrazine) is CH<sub>3</sub>(NH)NH<sub>2</sub>,
					otherwise known as monomethyl hydrazine. These propellants, being hypergolic, must be mixed with an oxidizer. The most
					prevalent hypergolic oxidizer is N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, A.K.A. dinitrogen tetroxide, or simply nitrogen tetroxide.<br><br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">The combustion reaction that hydrazine undergoes when oxidized with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is as follows:<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 6vh;">2N<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>H<sub><sub>4</sub>(l)</sub> + N<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O<sub><sub>4</sub>(l)</sub>
				→ 3N<sub><sub>2</sub>(g)</sub> + 4H<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Using Hess' Law and standard heats of formation, the net enthalpy change of this reaction can be found:<br><br></p>
			<p class="paragraph">ΔH = (3(0) + 4(-241.8)) - (1(9.2) + 4(50.6))<br>ΔH = -1178.8 kJ<br><br>This is still quite an exothermic reaction,
				but it's clear why it isn't used as the rocket's primary propulsion; APCP combustion is around 8 times as exothermic. That said, the
				controllability and convenience of hypergolic fuels make them very valuable in spaceflight. <br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Cryogenic Propellant</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Cryogenic propellants are, as the name suggest, simply propellants that must be stored at incredibly
				cold temperatures. Temperatures that are deemed cryogenic range from 123 K (-150 °C) to 0 K (-273 K). The reason why these propellants
				must be kept so cold is due to their low boiling points; if they weren't kept at these temperatures, they would vapourize and become
				gases. Like petroleum fuels, cryogenic propellants do not spontaneously combust, so they cannot use the standard LRB structure. Storing
				cryogenic propellants is inherently much more difficult than other liquid propellant types. The reason why this is still done is because
				of the sheer efficiency of the fuels.<br><br>
			</p>
			<div style="overflow: hidden;">
				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left" style="font-size: 3.75vh; line-height: 5.625vh;">Liquid hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is the most popular
					cryogenic propellant; this is mainly due to its high specific impulse, which makes it a very efficient choice. Liquid methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is another
					cryogenic propellant, but it is far less prevalent. It is less efficient, but its higher density makes it a good choice in situations with
					limited volume. Practically all cryogenic propellants use liquid oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidizer.<br><br>

			<p class="paragraph">The combustion reaction undergone by liquid hydrogen oxidized with liquid oxygen is as follows:<br><br></p>
