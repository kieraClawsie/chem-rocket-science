			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 4.5vh;">Rockets use propellants, fuels, and oxidizers.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">A propellant is made up of a fuel and an oxidizer
				and is the chemical mixture burned to generate thrust in rockets. Propellants are classified according to their state:
				liquid, solid, or hybrid. A Fuel is a substance that burns when combined with oxygen-producing gas for propulsion. An oxidizer
				is an agent that releases oxygen in combination with a fuel. For fuel to burn in space where no air exists, an oxidizer is
				necessary.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size: 4.5vh;">The mixture ratio is the ratio of oxidizer to fuel.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img class="figure" src="images/prop.JPG" style="width: 30vw; margin-left: -10vw;"><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Most rocket engines use chemical propellants. There are many types, such as liquid propellants,
				solid propellants, gelled propellants, hybrid propellants, or gaseous propellants, depending on their physical state. Most
				modern rockets use a combination of both solid and liquid fuel boosters. For the initial launch sequence, solid fuels are used
				because the speed needs to be at its maximum. Later on, liquid fuels are used so that the speed may be adjusted to get the
				rocket’s payload on to the right trajectory.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img class="figure" src="images/prop2.jpg" style="width: 30vw; margin-left: -10vw;"><br><br>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">The efficiency of rocket propellants is rated using specific impulse. Specific impulse is the change
				in momentum per unit mass (measured in pounds or kilograms) for rocket fuels. Specific impulse will vary depending on the
				type of propellant; however, its exact value will vary to some extent with the rocket engine's operating conditions and design.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle right">Solid Propellants</h2>
			<p class="paragraph right">Solid propellants are comprised of a mixture of fuel and
				oxidizer compounds already combined. Solid propellant
				motors consist of a casing, usually steel, filled with solid
				propellants that burn rapidly. Hot gases are expelled from a
				nozzle to produce thrust. A spark is all that is needed to start
				them burning. Once ignited a solid propellant burns from the
				center out towards the sides of the casing. The burn rate and
				pattern are dependent on the shape of the center channel,
				thus providing a means to control thrust. Once ignited, they
				cannot be stopped and will burn until all the propellant is
				exhausted. There are two types of solid propellant: <b>homogeneous propellant</b>
				and <b>composite propellant</b>.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph right">Homogeneous propellants come in 2 varieties.<br><br>Single base propellants consist of a single compound,
				usually nitrocellulose ((C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub>). Single
				base propellants have both an oxidation capacity and a reduction capacity.<br><br> Double base propllants consist of nitrocellulose
				and a secondary combustible, to which a plasticizer is added.Double base propellants do not produce traceable fumes and are
				commonly used in tactical weapons. Under normal conditions, homogeneous propellants do not usually have specific impulses greater 
				than about 210.<br><br>Modern composite propellants are
				made up of heterogeneous powders
				(mixtures) that use a crystallized or
				finely ground mineral salt as an
				oxidizer. The oxidizer used is often
				ammonium perchlorate (NH<sub>4</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>), and
				the fuel is aluminum. A polymeric binder
				(such as polyurethane or
				polybutadienes) holds the propellant
				together and is also consumed as fuel.<br><br>
				Sometimes, a catalyst such as an iron compound is added to help increase the
				burning rate. Composite propellants are often identified by the polymeric binder
				used. Two types of binders commonly used are polybutadiene
				acrylonitrile (PBAN) and hydroxy-terminator polybutadiene (HTPB).<br><br>The benefits of using PBAN formulations are that they have a slightly higher
				specific impulse, density, and burn rate than equivalent formulations using HTPB.
				The problem with PBAN propellant is that it is more challenging to mix and
				process and requires an elevated curing temperature. On the other hand, HTPB
				binder is stronger and more flexible than PBAN binder. Both PBAN and HTPB
				formulations result in propellants that deliver excellent performance, have good
				mechanical properties, and offer potentially long burn times.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle left">Liquid Propellants</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">A liquid propellant is used in a liquid-propellant rocket engine. In
				a liquid propellant rocket, the fuel and oxidizer are stored in
				separate tanks, and are combined in a combustion chamber
				where they are burned to produce thrust.<br><br>An excellent
				liquid propellant is one with a high specific impulse. This means
				it has a high combustion temperature and exhaust gases with
				small molecular weights. Another critical factor is the density of the propellant. Lower
				density propellants require larger storage tanks, thus increasing the mass of the launch
				vehicle. As well, storage temperature is essential.<br><br>

				<p class="paragraph floatLeft left">Petroleum fuels are highly refined forms of crude oil and are a mixture of complex
					hydrocarbons. The petroleum used as rocket fuel is highly refined kerosene mixed
					with liquid oxygen. Petroleum fuels are used as the propellant in the
					first-stage boosters of the Atlas
					and Delta II launch vehicles.
					Petroleum fuels were also used
					to power the first stages of the
					Saturn 1B and Saturn V
					rockets.<br><br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Hypergolic propellants are fuels and oxidizers that
				combust on contact with each other and require no ignition source. These fuels
				only need nitric acid to ignite, and therefore, the easy start and restart capability
				of hypergols make them ideal for spacecraft maneuvering systems. This
				spontaneity allows for an incredible degree of control over the thrust that
				boosters using hypergolic propellants supply. Also, hypergols remain liquid at
				normal temperatures and therefore do not have the storage problems of
				cryogenic propellants. Hypergols are highly toxic and must be handled with
				extreme care.<br><br>Common hypergolic fuels include hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine (MMH),
				unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). There are also blended fuels such as
				Aerozine 50, which is a combination of 50% UDMH and 50% hydrazine.
				Aerozine 50 + nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) was widely used in historical American
				rockets, including the Titan II, all engines in the Apollo Lunar Module, and the
				service propulsion system in the Apollo service module.<br><br>

				<p class="paragraph floatRight right" style="font-size: 3.75vh; line-height: 5.625vh;">Cryogenic propellants are liquefied
					gases stored at incredibly cold temperatures. Due to
					the low temperatures of cryogenic propellants, they
					are difficult to store over long periods. Cryogenic
					propellants do not spontaneously ignite. When
					reaction time and stability are not concerns, their high
					efficiency makes these very effective propellants.<br><br>

			<h2 class="subtitle left">Rocket Fuel Over Time</h2>
			<p class="paragraph left indent">Since the beginning of spaceflight, there have not been many changes in the chemistry
				of rocket fuel. However, scientists are busy trying to find ways to design more fuel-
				efficient rockets. Space launches can have a hefty carbon footprint due to the burning of
				solid rocket fuels. Obviously, to improve their efficiency, rockets need to be less fuel
				hungry. This means the fuel needs to be released out the back as fast as possible to
				give the desired momentum and achieve the same thrust. One possibility is to use
				ionized gases by propelling them through a rocket nozzle using a magnetic accelerator.
				Ionized gas weighs much less than traditional rocket fuels. The ionized particles are
				pushed out the back of the rocket at an incredibly high velocity, which compensates for
				their small weight or mass. Another possibility is the use of hydrogen peroxide. Some
				scientists believe it could be the critical element in a new class of eco-friendly rocket
				propellants and highly efficient fuel cells. Hydrogen peroxide for rocket propulsion would
				be made up of 3 percent water and 97 percent hydrogen peroxide with critical
				contaminants removed. This propulsion system could be an inexpensive alternative to
				non-renewable hydrocarbon fuels.<br><br>
